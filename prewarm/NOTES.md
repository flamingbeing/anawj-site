# Prewarming study app: notes

Lasting rules. Decisions with dates are in `PLAN.md` and `STATUS.md`.

- **Public repo:** never commit the eCRF template, the protocol or the paper data collection form (they carry staff
  names). Only the transcribed headers are here. Fake patients only, in tests and demo.
- **Study IDs only:** the app never asks for names, initials or hospital numbers. The Subject ID is exported in the
  template's Enrollment ID column (B).
- **Hospitals:** NTF, NUH, SGH, CGH, TTSH, KTPH, WH (`SITES` in `schema.js`). Each phone picks one in Settings; new
  patients record it (`site`, on the Extra sheet). With sharing, the join code will set it.
- **Blinding:** the randomisation group shows only on the pre-warming screen (and when the patient is created).
- **Columns:** `schema.js` lists fields in template column order; field n is column n. `test/prewarm.test.mjs` pins
  anchor columns. Never insert a template field out of order. Items with no template column go in `EXTRA` (exported
  on the "Extra" sheet).
- **Readings:** saving a timepoint stamps `at_<series>_<point>` with the clock time and initials; the Readings sheet
  is built from those. Gown set temp is NA for the no-pre-warming group and after "Active warming stopped".
- **Screens follow the day** (owner, 12 Oct 2026): opening a patient lands on one main screen: the event times as a
  compact grid (tap an empty one = now; tap a set one to change or clear it), then all temperatures with a
  Pre-warming / Intra-op switch (opens on Intra-op once the patient is in OT), then links to the other forms in the
  order they're filled in (BP/HR/BIS, intra-op details, PACU, satisfaction, form view).
- **Patient comfort** (owner, 12 Oct 2026): pre-op question at the top of the main screen, post-op at the bottom (no
  separate screen); one line once answered. "Spreadsheet view" (was Form view) is a text link under the other forms.
- **Join by code:** the hospital comes from the code's prefix (NTF-…), so nobody picks a hospital to join.
- **Service worker:** the page reloads only when an update takes over, never on the first install (a reload wiped the
  initials typed on the join screen).
- **Look:** the NUHS design system's app theme (the owner's "Kent Ridge Clinical" design system artifact, Mobile and
  web app section; `design/tokens.css`, Open Sans): white app bar with the four-quarter band (orange / red / stripe
  blue #178fd7 / navy), grey #f3f3f3 ground, white cards with 14px corners and hairlines, 10px controls, navy as the
  only accent (Save, selected chips, active tab), bold navy titles, 44px tap targets, dark toast at the top.
  Links are navy (link blue is under 4.5:1 on the grey page).
- **One screen per timepoint** (owner, 12 Oct 2026): the main screen fits a 390 × 844 phone down to Save without
  scrolling (e2e checks it): − value + on one row, chip rows with the label on the left, the "set the start time"
  hint in the due slot. Delete patient is on the Spreadsheet view, not the main screen.
- **Timer and next event** (owner, 12 Oct 2026): the patient screen's app bar shows a running timer (from warming on,
  else gown on, during pre-warming; from induction, else in OT, intra-op; the clock time before either) and the next
  event to note (the first unset of gown on, warming on, warming off, in OT, induction, surgery end, PACU arrival,
  to ward, after the last one set; warming off shows its expected time, 30 or 10 min after warming on).
- **Quick controls** (owner, 12 Oct 2026): a navy Log button in the app bar sets the next event to now (it replaced
  the Spreadsheet view icon; Spreadsheet view is the text link at the bottom). Big ‹ › buttons either side of the tabs
  and timepoint strip go to the previous / next timepoint. Event time boxes are squarer, six per row (two rows).
- **Mark section complete** sits at the very bottom of the screen, below the links, so it isn't tapped by accident.
- **Screen size** (Settings, this phone only): Smaller / Small / Normal / Large / Larger zooms the whole app
  (`--ui-zoom` on body). Normal by default.
- **Form view** (owner, 12 Oct 2026): the study's real paper form (data collection form v3.2, .docx) with text put in:
  ☐ → ☒ (and the Word tick box's checked flag), values over the blank lines and into empty cells, Subject ID on every
  page, Date of Entry and the sign-off (Name, Date) on pages with data; every page kept, unfilled ones blank.
  "Download Word file" gives the exact file; "Save as PDF / Print" shows it with docx-preview (Calibri via Carlito) and
  prints. docx-preview doesn't paginate like Word, so a long section can run onto an extra printed page.
  - The blank form is uploaded once by an admin (admin screen) to `forms/blank` (base64; members and admins read it;
    Firestore keeps a copy for offline use). Its file details (creator, last edited by, company) are removed on
    upload; never commit the form (staff name in its file details). The upload lists places the map didn't find.
  - Without an uploaded form (or not sharing), the Form view shows the older simple HTML version. Demo: choose a blank
    .docx on the Form view; it stays in that browser tab.
  - Subject ID: one character per box; longer IDs get the five boxes merged into one.
- **Defaults on tap:** an empty temperature becomes 36.5 (anywhere on its card, owner 12 Oct 2026) (then + / −, or tap again to type); an empty time becomes now.
- Gown set temp follows "Warming off" (NA for later timepoints) until someone picks a value on that screen.
- - **Entry screen:** option B ("change what moved"): values carry over from the last saved timepoint; + / − nudges;
  tap the number to type ("365" → 36.5). Hidden readings (Settings) stay blank.
- **Alerts** only work while the app is open; locked-phone alerts would need push notifications.
- **Sharing** (`js/cloud.js`, `firestore.rules`, Firebase project `prewarm-study`):
  - Phones join with their hospital's code (anonymous sign-in); the rules accept a `members/{uid}` entry only with that
    hospital's current code. Members read and write only their hospital's patients. A new code stops new joins with
    the old one; phones already in stay in until an admin removes them.
  - Admins sign in with an emailed link (Firebase "Email link" sign-in), not Google: phone browsers block the
    Google pop-up's helper page on `prewarm-study.firebaseapp.com` ("missing initial state"), and the self-hosted
    helper at `anawj.com/__/auth` belongs to the logbook's project. `admins/{email}` (lower-case email) lists them. The first admin is added by hand in the
    Firebase console; after that admins can add others there. Admins see every hospital, make codes, remove phones.
  - **Join links** (owner, 12 Oct 2026): the admin screen shares `anawj.com/prewarm/#/join/{site}/{code}` or shows it as
    a QR code (vendored qrcode-generator, as in evals). The code sits after the `#`, so it never reaches a server, and
    the app drops it from the address bar once joined. Codes stay long (8 characters); a link means nobody types them.
  - Each patient is one document; each field is merged on its own (`f.<id>: {v, t, by}`), newest edit wins when
    copies meet. localStorage stays the phone's working copy; Firestore keeps its own offline cache and sends when
    there is signal.
  - Membership is checked on the server, not the local cache (a refused join briefly shows in the cache).
  - Remote changes redraw the list, patient and form-view screens; on reading and form screens a bar offers to show
    them, so a half-entered reading is never lost.
- **Deploys:** a merge that changes `.github/workflows/deploy-firestore-rules.yml` and a rules file together may not
  start a run (it happened with #196); check Actions, and touch the rules file in a later PR if it didn't run.
- **Testing sharing:** `tools/test-rules.sh` (rules, 52 checks) and `tools/test-prewarm-sync.sh` (two phones in a
  browser against the local Firestore and Auth emulators, `?emulator` on localhost only). Never the live project.
- Changing any file in `sw.js` SHELL means bumping `VERSION`.
