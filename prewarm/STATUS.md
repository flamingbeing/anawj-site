# Prewarming study app status

Short and current. Lasting rules go in `NOTES.md`. Update with `/save-state`.

Last updated: 2026-10-12 by Claude Code, Prewarming Webapp.

## Now

- **Claude Code, Prewarming Webapp** (branch `ccr-13264f37-d28edu`): Word-form Form view (PR open).

## Waiting on the owner

- Upload the blank paper form (.docx) on the admin screen, then check a patient's Form view on a phone (Download
  Word file, Save as PDF / Print).

## Next

1. Export across hospitals for admins, a members' view of who entered what, polish after phone testing.

## Recently done

## Decisions

- 12 Oct 2026: Log out (deletes the phone's patients, warns, warns again if unsynced) replaces Stop sharing. Join links sent
  to the teams and working (owner).
- 12 Oct 2026: completed patients warn before opening; Export Excel moves to Settings.
- 12 Oct 2026: Cloudflare PR previews fixed by the owner (build settings); main copy at
  anawj-preview.kohwenjun.workers.dev.
- 12 Oct 2026: "Mark data collection as complete" (one per patient) replaces the main screen's section mark; shown at the
  top of the main screen and in the patient list.
- 12 Oct 2026: delete participants only from Settings → Delete participants; every reading entered live by default.
- 12 Oct 2026: Log button (next event), ‹ › timepoints, squarer time boxes, Mark section complete at the bottom, tap an
  empty temperature card for 36.5, running timer and next event in the app bar.
- 12 Oct 2026: NUHS app theme (design system artifact, kr-app); main screen fits one phone screen; Delete moves to the
  Spreadsheet view; Screen size setting (per phone, Normal by default).
- 12 Oct 2026: Form view should be the Word form itself, filled in; the blank form is uploaded by an admin (private),
  outputs Word download + PDF/print.
- 12 Oct 2026: NUHS design system look (as evals); "Form view" = paper-form layout, "Spreadsheet view" = grid.
- 12 Oct 2026: comfort questions on the main screen (pre-op top, post-op bottom); hospital comes from the join code.
- 12 Oct 2026: keep 8-character codes; teams join by link or QR instead of typing (4 digits too easy to guess).
- 12 Oct 2026: admins sign in by email link, not Google (phone browsers broke the Google pop-up).
- 12 Oct 2026: main screen = event times (compact) + all temperatures, links to other forms in fill-in order; empty
  temperature taps to 36.5, empty time taps to now.
- 12 Oct 2026: scope is op-day bedside data; template timepoints; intraop 0 min = induction; entry screen option B;
  join code, new Firebase project, several hospitals; group shown only on the pre-warming screen; Subject ID in the
  Enrollment ID column; vitals baseline-only by default; keep data until the study ends. Full list in `PLAN.md`.
- 12 Oct 2026: Firebase project `prewarm-study` created by the owner; `firebase-rules-deployer@apmes-logbook` has
  Firebase Rules Admin on it.
